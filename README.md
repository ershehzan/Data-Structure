# 🧠 Data-Structure  
A complete collection of essential **Data Structure and Algorithm implementations in C++**.

---

## 📘 Overview
This repository contains well-structured C++ implementations of various **Data Structures** (like Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Heaps, etc.) and **Algorithms** (like Sorting, Searching, Recursion, Greedy, Backtracking, etc.).  
It is designed for:
- Students learning DSA fundamentals  
- Competitive programmers  
- Interview preparation and practice  
- Developers who want quick reference implementations
