## 📘 Overview

This repository provides clean and modular C++ implementations of fundamental:

### **📌 Data Structures**

* Arrays
* Linked Lists
* Stacks
* Queues
* Trees
* Graphs
* Heaps / Priority Queues
* Vectors
* Strings

### **📌 Algorithms**

* Sorting (Bubble, Merge, Quick, Selection, Insertion)
* Searching (Linear, Binary)
* Recursion
* Greedy Algorithms
* Backtracking
* Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS, etc.)
* STL usage in C++
